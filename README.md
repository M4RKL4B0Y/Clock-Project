# Clock-Project

The game is Clock-It! 



Inspired by my wife who loves analog clocks, the objective of this game will teach players how to read them. 

We have analog clocks in almost every room of our home and my wife would love for our 3 little children to learn how to tell time.



This project incorporates the use of HTML, CSS AND JS. The HTML gave me the ability to create the structure of the clock, while the CSS gave it some style. The JS file allows the clock to function in real-time.



Ambitions:

Project still needs work. I would like for the hands of the clock to be fixed on a time and for the user to type in the time displayed on the clock. 

I would like to incorporate 3 levels of difficulty, easy, normal, expert. 

Easy mode would just display the hours of the clock. 
This would be for the users who are learning how to tell the time by the hour and minute (increments of 5). 

Normal would display the hours and minutes which the user would for type in. 

Expert would display hours, minutes and seconds which the user would have to type in.
